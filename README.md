# FAABP
A multi-agent based simulation code combining a physics engine and logic and communication

greens.py - sets the "green function" for the interaction (choice of function sets boundary condition, type of interaction, potential etc.)
timepropogation.py - has the runge kutta integrator
ecoSystem.py - the class the contains the ecosystem (coordinates and various other parameters of particles)
runPhaseSpace.py - the code to run and set the various parameters for the simulation (Number of particles, size of system, speed, curvity etc)
